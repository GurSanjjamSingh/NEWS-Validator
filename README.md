# NEWS-Validator
A machine learning-based project to classify news articles as “Fake News” or “Not Fake News” using popular algorithms like <br>
Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest.
  •	Preprocessing text data for feature extraction using TF-IDF Vectorizer.
  •	Classification using multiple machine learning models.
	•	Predicting fake news with input from users.
	•	Supports Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest for prediction.


# How it works?
Text Preprocessing:
	•	Tokenization and cleaning of news text using the wordopt function.
	•	Feature extraction via TF-IDF Vectorizer.
 
Machine Learning Models:
	•	Train models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest) on the dataset.
	•	Use trained models to predict user-provided news articles.
 
Classification Output:
	•	Provides predictions for each model.

 # Dependencies
  •	pandas
	•	numpy
	•	sklearn
	•	seaborn
